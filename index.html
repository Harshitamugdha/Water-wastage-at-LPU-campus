        <h2>Introduction to Water Wastage</h2>
        <p>Water wastage refers to the inefficient or unnecessary use of water, leading to the depletion of this precious resource. In modern times, water scarcity has become a global issue, making the efficient use of water more critical than ever. Institutions like Lovely Professional University (LPU), with its large population and extensive facilities, consume significant amounts of water daily. Without careful management, much of this water can be wasted through leaking infrastructure, overuse in hostels and canteens, and inefficient irrigation of green spaces.</p>

    <section id="importance">
        <h2>Importance of Water</h2>
        <p>Water is vital for all life forms and is used for drinking, sanitation, agriculture, and various industrial processes. At LPU, water supports academic, residential, and recreational needs. Conserving water is essential for ensuring a sustainable future for the campus and beyond.</p>

        <h2>Causes of Water Wastage at LPU</h2>
        <p>LPU, being a prominent educational institution, serves as a microcosm of larger societal water usage challenges. Its sprawling campus includes hostels, academic buildings, sports facilities, gardens, and canteens, all of which rely on water. However, like many large institutions, LPU faces challenges in managing water efficiently. Recognizing the importance of water conservation, LPU has taken several steps to reduce water wastage, but there is still significant room for improvement. This report investigates the causes of water wastage, its impact, existing conservation methods, and new strategies that can help LPU reduce its water consumption and set an example for other institutions.
